# Neuromechanics-of-Interaction

## The Neuromechanics of a Haptic Free Virtual Reality Interaction Vs. The Physical World 
### Summary of the Work:
Virtual reality (VR) technologies are continuously being adopted as training systems across many domains. Each domain often requires users to interact with virtual objects within the simulated environment. Recent studies have suggested that understanding user-object interaction fidelity can provide essential information about the feasibility of VR as a tool to enhance user performance. Since an implicit goal of all VR systems is to provide users with an experience that is perceived as realistic to improve performance, there is a clear need for metrics that can quantify essential attributes of the user’s interaction with the virtual environment (VE). To address this need, this work proposes an objective, user-centric metric approach that considers the neuromechanics underlying the user’s behavior that would allow for a quantitative analysis between object manipulations conducted in the real world and a haptic-free VE. It is hypothesized that the movement pattern of object manipulation in a haptic-free VE and the real world are largely consistent. In this pilot study, the examination of specific features of hand kinematics and electromyography during the pre-and-post-contact phases of a pick-and-place task revealed significant differences between the real world and the haptic free-VE. In the future, this paradigm will be applied as a framework to evaluate haptic displays and analyze the technology’s effects on the neuromechanics of user-object interaction toward making VR more realistic.
